            <h1 class="about">About...</h1>
            <p>Visit Flag Fen Archaeology Park to explore how the prehistoric people of the fen lived over 3000 years
                ago. Wander through a Bronze Age village, sit within the reconstructed roundhouses, and stand where our
                ancestors once stood by the ritual causeway.</p>
            <p>Experience life in our prehistoric past and visit the only place in the UK where original Bronze Age
                remains can be seen in situ, the incredibly preserved timbers of a monumental engineering achievement.
            </p>
            <p>Excavations on the site revealed details of a wooden platform and post alignment that stretch for nearly
                a kilometre across the fen. These were built up between 1350 and 950BC and are of great national and
                international significance. Due to the waterlogged nature of the fens, this unique monument has been
                remarkably preserved.</p>
            <p>It is believed that the post alignment consists of 60,000 vertical timber and 250,000 horizontal pieces
                of wood, spanning the wet and marshy fen to meet a droveway on dry ground at each end. All the pieces of
                wood had been worked and shaped with tools.</p>
            <p>People gave many thousands of hours to build this structure. Could it have been a boundary and defensive
                structure protecting the valuable resources of the fen? Could it have been created as a bridge to drive
                cattle across the fen?</p>
            <p>Within the structure, many hundreds of metal, stone and bone artefacts have been found. These items have
                not been lost – they were deliberately placed. Equally, they have not been found in a hoard hidden away
                for safety. Furthermore, excavations have uncovered large amounts of animal bone (sheep, cows, pigs)
                showing signs of butchery – was feasting taking place here?</p>
            <p>See the stunning range of ancient objects found on the site in our museum, including weapons, jewellery
                and even England’s oldest wheel! It is believed that many of these were placed into the waters as ritual
                offerings to the gods or spirits by our prehistoric ancestors.
